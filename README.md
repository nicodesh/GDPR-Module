# GDPR Module

I made this module for Digimood, a webmarketing agency.

This module make your life easier to be GDPR compliant about the Cookie Privacy Policy.

## Getting Started

You just have a index.html, which is an (almost) empty exemple of a web page.

Inside, you can find the HTML bloc, compound of 3 <div>.

Then, you have a CSS file that you have to call on each web page.

And finally, the JavaScript code that you have to call before the </body> tag.

### Prerequisites

This module was made to run with GTM, but you can easily rearange it if you want to make it run with another TMS or even without TMS.

### Installing

1. Include the HTML part in all your web pages.
2. Call the CSS file in all your web pages.
3. Call the JS file in all your web pages, in the footer, juste before the body closing.

That's it!

## Settings

There are three consent levels.

1. Technical cookies only.
2. Technical cookies + Analytics cookies
3. Technical cookies + Analytics cookies + Marketing cookies

The module is in french, so you have to adapt the text content.

All text contents are push in JavaScript, in order to be SEO friendly.
